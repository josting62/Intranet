# React + TypeScript + Vite: IPS Clinic Intranet System

This project is built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**, providing a fast and scalable solution for developing a dynamic intranet system for an IPS-type clinic. The system manages important functionalities like document filing and patient procedure tracking (commonly referred to as *cups* in medical terminology).

## Key Features

- **Fast Development with Vite**: Vite offers instant server startup and Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for smooth, efficient development.
- **Type Safety with TypeScript**: TypeScript ensures type safety throughout the project, minimizing bugs and improving maintainability.
- **Modern React Setup**: Utilizes modern React features, including hooks, functional components, and JSX syntax for clean and modular development.

## Project Overview

This intranet system is designed to support clinics by providing core functionalities such as:

- **Document Filing**: Allows the secure storage and organization of clinic-related documents, ensuring easy access and retrieval.
- **Patient Procedure Management**: Simplifies the tracking of patient procedures (*cups*), streamlining operations and improving efficiency.

The system leverages the power of modern web technologies, offering a responsive and user-friendly interface that ensures seamless interactions between clinic staff and the system.

## Advantages of This Project

1. **Speed and Performance**: Viteâ€™s optimized build process ensures quick page loads and fast development cycles, making this system ideal for real-time clinic operations.
   
2. **Scalability**: Built with React and TypeScript, this project is highly scalable. The modular structure allows for the easy addition of new features or changes as the clinic's needs evolve.

3. **Robust Type Checking**: TypeScript improves the reliability of the codebase by catching errors early, resulting in fewer runtime bugs and increased productivity during development.

4. **Maintainability**: Using React's component-based architecture, this project is easy to maintain and update, allowing for simple management of UI and business logic.

## Technical Details

This template includes the following official Vite plugins:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh and enhanced development experience.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for faster builds and Fast Refresh.

### Expanding the ESLint Configuration

For production applications, it's recommended to expand the ESLint configuration to include type-aware linting rules:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
});
